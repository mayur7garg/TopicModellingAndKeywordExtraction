      "\"With the emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), there is a growing need for access control and data protection on low-power, pervasive devices. Biometric-based authentication is promising for IoT due to its convenient nature and lower susceptibility to attacks. However, the costs associated with biometric processing and template protection are nontrivial for smart cards, key fobs, and so forth. In this paper, we discuss the security, cost, and utility of biometric systems and develop two major frameworks for improving them. First, we introduce a new framework for implementing biometric systems based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and hardware obfuscation that, unlike traditional software approaches, does not require nonvolatile storage of a biometric template/key. Aside from reducing the risk of compromising the biometric, the nature of obfuscation also provides protection against access control circumvention via malware and fault injection. The PUF provides non-invertibility and non-linkability. Second, a major requirement of the proposed PUF/obfuscation approach is that a reliable (robust) key be generated from the users input biometric. We propose a noiseaware biometric quantization framework capable of generating unique, reliable keys with reduced enrollment time and denoising costs. Finally, we conduct several case studies. In the first, the proposed noise-aware approach is compared to our previous approach for multiple biometric modalities, including popular ones (fingerprint and iris) and emerging cardiovascular ones (ECG and PPG). The results show that ECG provides the best tradeoff between reliability, key length, entropy, and cost. In the second and third case studies, we demonstrate how reliability, denoising costs, and enrollment times can be simultaneously improved by modeling subject intra-variations for ECG. \"\n",

      "\"Schummer (Journal of Economic Theory 2000) introduced the concept of bribeproof mechanism which, in a context where monetary transfer between agents is possible, requires that manipulations through bribes are ruled out. Unfortunately, in many domains, the only bribeproof mechanisms are the trivial ones which return a fixed outcome. This work presents one of the few constructions of non-trivial bribeproof mechanisms for these quasi-linear environments. Though the suggested construction applies to rather restricted domains, the results obtained are tight: For several natural problems, the method yields the only possible bribeproof mechanism and no such mechanism is possible on more general domains. \"\n",

      "\"We have derived the integral form of the cusp and node coalescence conditions satisfied by the wavefunction at the coalescence of two charged particles in $D \\geq 2$ dimension space. From it we have obtained the differential form of the coalescence conditions. These expressions reduce to the well-known integral and differential coalescence conditions in $D = 3$ space. It follows from the results derived that the approximate Laughlin wavefunction for the fractional Quantum Hall Effect satisfies the node coalescence condition. It is further noted that the integral form makes evident that unlike the electron-nucleus coalescence condition, the differential form of the electron-electron coalescence condition cannot be expressed in terms of the electron density at the point of coalescence. From the integral form, the integral and differential coalescence conditions for the pair-correlation function in $D\\geq 2$ dimension space are also derived. The known differential form of the pair function cusp condition for the uniform electron gas in dimensions $D = 2,3$ constitute a special case of the result derived. \"\n",
